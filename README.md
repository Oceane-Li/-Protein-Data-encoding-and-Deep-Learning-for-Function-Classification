# Protein-Data-encoding-and-Deep-Learning-for-Function-Classification
The goal of this project will be to predict function of proteins using Deep Learning methods based on their sequence.

The input data needed to test the code is available at [SwissProt](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=reviewed:true)
